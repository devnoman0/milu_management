        answer : " This depends on how quickly and regularly you are able to provide us content. Without you providing us content we cannot use our Rabbit Holeâ„¢ marketing formula And if we cannot market then there will be no subscribers for the seduction sales team to sell to - which means less profits for you. If you put 100% into creating content we can put 100% into sales and marketing."
